**Stats Page:** Displays statistics about gameplay, including the number of games played, the average number of guesses per game, and a bar chart showing guesses for each game.
**Interactive Gameplay:** Users are prompted with questions about the animal they’re thinking of, and based on the answers, the app attempts to guess the correct animal.

**OpenAI Integration:** Uses OpenAI to make a more intelligent and dynamic guess about the animal based on the user’s responses.

**Game Statistics:** After each game, the app tracks important statistics such as the total number of games played, the average number of guesses per game, and more.

**Bar Chart Visualization:** Displays a bar chart representing the number of guesses made during each game to give a visual summary of the user's performance.
